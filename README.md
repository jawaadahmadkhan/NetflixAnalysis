# Measuring Streaming Success: Netflix Data Analysis Project
A business analyst research project analyzing Netflix data from Q3 2021 to Q1 2023 to examine measures of success and effectiveness of original programming, utilizing Excel and Tableau. (Originally completed July 2023)

## Project Description
This project is a full Research memorandum examining the question of measuring media success metrics in the new streaming-dominated landscape. The full document (attached as file: "Measuring_Streaming_Success_by_Jawaad_Khan.pdf") gives the research background examining the history of media metrics for the film industry, and introducing this project's look at Netflix as a case study of modern streaming platforms.

In this project, I examine Netflix's "Top 10 Weekly" titles asking how these top titles' attributes affect the success of Netflix as a company overall in its revenue and subscriber growth. I utilize data from:
1. Netflix's Global Top 10 Weekly List (https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/ )
2. Company revenue data from aggregator Business of Apps (https://www.businessofapps.com/data/netflix-statistics )
3. Netflix's 10-K form from 2022 (https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/4e32b45c-a99e-4c7d-b988-4eef8377500c.pdf )
4. Netflix Originals, extrapolated from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Netflix_original_programming )

## Business Value
This analysis can be useful to companies in the streaming space to provide insights into how original content vs. licensed content can affect subscripership and revenue growth over time.

## Research Question
In this analysis, I explored the broader topic of how to measure streaming success by specifically examining Netflix’s company data as a case study. In that, the primary question was: **looking at the available data for the last 2 years of Netflix’s “Top 10 Weekly” titles, how do these top titles’ attributes affect the success of Netflix as an overall company in regard to its revenue and subscriber growth?**

In conducting these analyses, I purporting the following hypotheses to test:
1.	Increased weekly views of films and television correlate to increased revenue & subscribership.
2.	Netflix original titles are the majority of its “Top 10 Weekly” titles.
3.	After introducing Netflix original titles, Netflix experienced at least 10% growth YoY.

## Findings & Takeaways
In analyzing the dataset, I created a few visualizations to discover trends. See full Tableau workbook, uploaded as "Netflix_Data_Analysis.twbx".

Some key takeaways from this exploration and analysis:
•	The hours viewed of Top 10 films and TV shows metric doesn’t neatly correlate to greater revenue and subscribership (and it’s likely several factors including policy updates, the greater catalog of films, marketing investment, technology updates, and competition that may contribute more substantially to revenue and subscribership).
•	Netflix’s Originals are still only around 18% of its Top 10 most watched films and TV shows, which means its most successful content, by this metric, is still majorly dominated by licensed media. This creates a further question on whether the investment in originals is worth it (which can be explored by not just the viewership, but also survey data on why people chose to subscribe, as the marketing of new content regularly may pull people in, but once they’re subscribed, they may defer to watching and re-watching licensed media they already like).
•	The introduction of Netflix originals coincided with a huge amount of revenue increase for the company with around 20-30% consistent growth Year over Year. This may not fully indicate a causal relationship, but undoubtedly Netflix’s entrée into the world of production changed its reputation and just might have raised its profile enough to have garnered much more revenue as a result.
